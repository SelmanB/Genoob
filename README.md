Genetic Algorithm workplace for the "noober" BOUN Hashcode team

Initial proposition for the software architecture is as follows:

Components{

  Generic problem template with:

    Evaluator,
    
    Cross-over operator(Breeder),
    
    Random Initializer;
  
  Random Number Generator;
  
  Random Mutator;
  
  Random Killer(Selecting better options according to Boltzmann's Distribution);
  
  Tools to set parameters dynamically;
  
  }
  
  Or...
